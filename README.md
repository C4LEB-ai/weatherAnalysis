# Weather Constraint Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict weather constraints using datasets from NIMET (Nigerian Meteorological Agency) and NASA. The objective is to accurately model and forecast temperature, pressure, and relative humidity, which are key indicators of weather conditions. The insights gained from this project can be applied to improve weather prediction accuracy, aiding decision-making in sectors like agriculture, aviation, and disaster management.

## Features
- **Temperature:** A critical indicator of weather conditions, influencing numerous environmental and economic factors.
- **Pressure:** An essential factor in predicting weather patterns and phenomena such as storms and cyclones.
- **Relative Humidity:** Plays a significant role in determining the comfort levels, precipitation, and other weather-related events.

## Data Sources
- **NIMET:** Nigerian Meteorological Agency dataset.
- **NASA:** National Aeronautics and Space Administration dataset.

## Model Development
Machine learning models were developed for each of the three features:
- **Temperature Prediction Model**
- **Pressure Prediction Model**
- **Relative Humidity Prediction Model**

## Techniques and Tools Used
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the datasets for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting and transforming features to improve model performance.
- **Modeling:** Implementing regression models to predict each weather feature.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Models were evaluated using performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and others.

## Project Outcomes
- **Temperature Prediction Model:** Achieved high accuracy, indicating the model's robustness in predicting temperature based on input features.
- **Pressure Prediction Model:** Demonstrated strong performance in forecasting pressure, making it reliable for weather analysis.
- **Relative Humidity Prediction Model:** Provided accurate predictions, crucial for understanding and managing humidity-related weather constraints.
